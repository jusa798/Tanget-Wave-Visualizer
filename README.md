# Tanget-Wave-Visualizer
Having fun with moving waves! 


## Sliders

The first slider affects the waves **width**. It increases quite large, and on mobile the increase is very noticeable. On PC or laptop it is a bit easier to see. 

The second slider afects the waves **angular velocity**. Its increase is also quite large, and the waves almost seem to slow down once they go so fast! 

This project was made just messing around with the P5 visualization library. It can also be seen on jrbeltran.com.
